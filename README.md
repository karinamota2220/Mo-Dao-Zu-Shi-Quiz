The purpose of this project is to create a Mo Dao Zu Shi quiz website using HTML and JavaScript, allowing fans to test their knowledge of the series through interactive quizzes.
This project is useful because it provides Mo Dao Zu Shi fans with an engaging and interactive way to test their knowledge, enhancing their experience with the series. Unlike general quiz websites, this project is specifically tailored to the Mo Dao Zu Shi universe, offering questions and content that are highly relevant to fans
This project aims to foster a sense of community among fans, encouraging them to share their scores and challenge friends to beat their results. By doing so, it enhances the overall fan experience, making it a valuable resource for both newcomers and long-time followers of the series.
Through this initiative, we hope to celebrate the rich world of Mo Dao Zu Shi, bringing fans closer to the content they love while providing them with an innovative platform to showcase their knowledge and enthusiasm.
